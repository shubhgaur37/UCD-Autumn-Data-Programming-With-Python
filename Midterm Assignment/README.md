# Midterm Assignment - Data Programming with Python

## Overview
This directory contains the midterm assignment for the "Data Programming with Python" module, focused on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Irish weather data. This analysis uses data from Met Éireann and covers various aspects of data handling and visualization.

## Assignment Details
- **Objective**: Apply Python programming skills to perform EDA on historic weather data.
- **Data Source**: Met Éireann, Ireland's National Meteorological Service.

## Assignment Questions

### 1. Data Description
- **Task**: Load the `weather.csv` dataset into Python as a pandas DataFrame. Describe the data.
  - How many years of recordings are included?
  - What is the temporal resolution of the data?
  - Which weather measurements are reported?

### 2. Missing Value Analysis
- **Task**: Determine how many missing values there are in each column of the dataset.
  - Discuss possible reasons for these missing values.
  - Suggest different strategies for filling the missing values, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each strategy in the context of this dataset.

### 3. Extreme Weather Events
- **Task**: Write code to answer the following questions:
  - At what station and on what date was the highest wind speed recorded?
  - At what station and on what date was the highest maximum air temperature recorded?
  - At what station and on what date was the largest amount of rain recorded?

### 4. Numerical Summary
- **Task**: Create a numerical summary (mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, etc.) for each of the weather measurements.
  - Discuss and interpret your results.

### 5. Graphical Summary
- **Task**: Create a graphical summary for each of the weather measurements.
  - Discuss your plots in relation to the summary statistics found in question 4.

### 6. Wind Analysis
- **Task**: Produce a scatter plot of the mean wind speed versus the highest gust and color your points based on month.
  - Interpret your plot.

### 7. Daily Temperature Range
- **Task**: Compute the daily temperature range and add this as an additional variable to your DataFrame.
  - Print out the last 10 rows of your DataFrame to show that the column has been added correctly.

### 8. Temperature Range vs. Sunlight
- **Task**: Plot the daily temperature range versus the hours of sunlight per day, coloring the points based on month.
  - Interpret your plot.

### 9. Comparative Analysis
- **Task**: Perform a comparative analysis of the weather at Dublin Airport, Shannon Airport, and Cork Airport.
  - Create numerical and graphical summaries of the weather measurements at each weather station.
  - Discuss how the weather differs (or is similar) across these locations.
